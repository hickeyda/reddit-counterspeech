Do you know someone who does triathlons, meditates, showers 3 times a day, works full-time, perfectly balances his free time between social activities, personal hobbies (that make him a better person, like learning Chinese or some other shit) and distributing soup to the homeless?  I don't. Because people don't do that, and that's normal. They go to the gym maybe once or twice a week for some time, then stop for months. They spend their evenings and weekends binge watching random crap because they feel tired after the shit they had at work, or simply spending time with their families.  Maybe they should lose a bit of weight, actually finish writing that story they began three years ago, go on that morning run, drink a bit less. They will try, they will fail, they will try again, stuff will happen and their priorities will shift. That's life.  But none of this has any real effect on their ""relationship potential"". Sure, if you're very obese, then losing weight will help you in many ways. If you're clinically depressed and can't function normally, then getting treated for it would be a game-changer. But most people aren't. Most people are average. Most people struggle with relationships, get with someone, have break ups, spend time alone, rince and repeat, and usually end up with someone long-term, even if it's not perfect.  Sure, try to become a better person. Everybody should do that. But it won't solve your relationship issues.",1,0,0,1.0,1.0

There were people alive under the rubble and considering it was in downtown Manhattan, they couldn't exactly put it on the sidewalk while they were rescuing human beings.      Again, no government source claimed that the steel beams melted; they didn't have to. IIRC, steel can start to lose it's integrity around 1200 degree Fahrenheit. That is enough to cause the collapse.

This plus the whole Feminine Empowerment movement creates a class of bitchy Mega-Cunts in today's toxic dating environment.

Do this with the most arrogant, smug, shit-eating grin you can naturally pull off. Not saying to be narcissistic, but flowing with self-confidence.

do1sfxz,TheRedPill,"Today I finally managed to hit it off. It changed my view over pussy.. Ok, so I'm a long time lurker here and it feels like it's about damn time I give something back to TRP.   To keep the story short and on point - I basically had sex after a long, and I mean really long, dry period - to the point where I felt virgin again. Only a year ago I have moved out of the dorm and finally had some private space, found a decent job that gave me opportunity to receive some kind of social status and therefore my confidence grew along with that, renewed my style and received a lot of compliments how refreshed I look, have been hitting gym for 10 months straight now and finally - been heavily practising night game in bars / clubs to the point where I got decent enough to eventually get action almost every time, which of course led to today, where I got laid...   The hype over pussy is immoderate and overrated - those were my first thoughts after failing to find the release for two times, while drunk and in the morning, my sore dick to this moment still reminding me of the disappointment I have found. Sure, it still feels like some sorts of minor achievement to be able to conquer someone, it wasn't that bad either - yet I have realized how silly it was of me to drool over this shit in my fantasies a year, two, ten ago.   Obviously, it was the moment where I truly realized how ignorant it is to make pussy one's life goal. Ironically life revolves around sex. It was the drive, the motivation to get myself out of my own ass and start exploring the world, after all. That was how it all started, that's how I found TRP. Things got different and such was an important play for the self-grow and awakening experience.   Once you start enjoying self-improvement road sex becomes insignificant, petty conquest, a mere drop in the ocean. There's so much more that can be done, so many more pleasurable experiences that can be found... I guess that's my point after all - don't settle for the small victories.   Pussy is fine but don't lose your head chasing it. If opportunity presents, get it - whatever. But in the end it's not worth stressing for.   Albeit TRP is a way to design our best sexual strategy, it's not just that. The pill is hard to swallow for a reason. Truth hurts and people are too lazy to run a self-improvement marathon. That's what the real core of TRP is to me and it should be for you too.","I'm new here and to be honest, most of the info on here is like some sort of robotic, soulless, pussy conquest manual.

drt154r,Braincels,"I don't believe in advice via PMs - it robs subreddits of valuable content, looks like you're afraid of your suggestions falling apart under the light of day and allows for unverifiable claims of having helped so-and-so-many incels. Let's recap what I wrote above about some things being incel does for me > a sense of belonging and feeling understood, making sense of one's isolation and pain, assurance that it really is ok not to try if you don't want to, external confirmation that your feelings of self-hate and being a failure are not only justified but well-deserved [that's where ""normies"" come into play] How does ""get a social hobby"" address any of that? That's exactly the thing I complained about. E.g. an actual alternative to being incel (that obviously would pose no improvement whatsoever) would be to identify as a neo-nazi: * sense of belonging and feeling understood? probably, lots of misfits and outcasts congregating there. * making sense of isolation and pain? check, I could believe that people shun and hate me for my political views. * ok not to try? depends, but at least I wouldn't have to be successful by normal societal standards. * validation of self-hate? check, being a nazi would make me despicable beyond redemption. But that discussion is pointless at this point - on the one hand I do now know where I belong (which I didn't when I was posting on exredpill), on the other hand I'm pretty much stuck with the incel identity because dropping it now only would mean giving in to bullies.","Have you tried the community at r/foreveralone ? It fits pretty much all the criteria you've mentioned except without blaming everything on women and constructing false and hurtful narratives against them. I've noticed many incels have gone there already too. The following is some humble (perhaps unrequested) advice from me, for whatever it's worth, feel free to take it or leave it: First, >assurance that it really is ok not to try if you don't want to I assure you, most people think that way, or at nearly every community has a portion of people who believe this. I certainly do. It's nobody's life except yours, and you should feel free to do what you will with it- so long as you don't harm others. Now, that last part is tricky, but most societies just request that you don't physically or verbally hurt others. Pretty easy, I should think, especially if you're not trying. Second >external confirmation that your feelings of self-hate and being a failure are not only justified but well-deserved I really think this is counterproductive. Nobody knows you as well as you know yourself, so you really shouldn't be looking for people to confirm why you're a failure. You do not need a community built around this thought. Only you can chastise and judge yourself accurately, and I think that's enough. Further, keep in mind, these thoughts are only helpful so long as they're motivating you to improve yourself or change your situation for the better. Think about this logically: if they're making you miserable without presenting any benefit, shouldn't you do your best to get rid of them? Now, your thoughts are not easily controllable, don't think I'm saying that. But distancing yourself from external factors that contribute to your misery and not to your benefit is a logical step, don't you agree?","Here's a sneak peek of /r/ForeverAlone using the [top posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/top/?sort=top&t=year) of the year! \#1: [&lt;---- Number of people all alone on New Year's Eve](https://np.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/5l8bnj/number_of_people_all_alone_on_new_years_eve/) \#2: [PSA: If You're Asking Yourself, ""Why am I Getting Judged On this Subreddit?""

Everything a girl or woman does is under scrutiny. Appearance, sexuality, hopes and dreams, beliefs, hobbies, personality, all the things that makes us human...to men it's all an inconvinience or even an affront to their sensibilities. If you maintain your appearance to fit the current beauty standard, you're a ""vapid bitch"", a slut, just a dumb ""basic"" girl with no other value than her looks. Good luck having an interest you're passionate about, because men will only ever look at you as a sex object at best and at worst, a vain bitch that needs to be put in her place. And if you don't care much about your appearance or you're just plain ugly, you are of no value to most men. (see: r/Trufemcels) You have sex? Whore. You don't have sex? Prude. We've all seen these double standards and they've been discussed to death already but nothing changes. Imagine being a man - you could take a stroll at night, meet likeminded people at any bar and solo travel to any country without ever worrying about being raped and left for dead. If you get into a fight, you're strong enough physically to be on a level playing field with your attacker. And if you do get hurt and press charges, the judge won't ask why you were provoking the attacker by walking through the wrong neighborhood or wearing revealing clothes. The world is unsafe because of men, yet they can live in it relatively unharmed. It is a grave injustice that the women who make life itself possible on this dumpsterfire of a planet are treated the way we are. There is nothing you can do as a woman that won't infuriate, annoy or inconvenience the men around you, and every part of you will be sexualized beginning at a very young age. Obviously there are bigger fish to fry when it comes to women's rights - worries about porn, catcalling and casual sexism are valid and should be worked on alongside the truly monstrous practices like rape, honor killings and FGM.

And when he said yes I just got quiet sad, and he didn't understand why.

ckvrvxc,NeoFAG,<MISSING>,"If by ""serious critique of NeoGAF shut down and silenced"" you mean the critique posted directly on NeoGAF that gets locked/deleted - then yes, you're right that it has no effect. But that doesn't mean it's silenced everywhere. It's probably only really silenced on GAF itself, or some other forum that just doesn't want to deal with NeoGAF's bullshit at all (and who could blame them). There is definitely at least some demand out there to talk about how badly NeoGAF is run. Dragging Evilore through the mud can be funny, too, at least until the guy gets over himself and grows a real personality. I would like to make several points about why NeoGAF shouldn't be the 'definitive' internet gaming community that people think it is; points that a lot of reasonable people could probably agree with; points that even people who this sub calls part of the hivemind/hugbox could probably agree with. People in this thread seem to be saying ""we get shutdown/silenced when we use serious and civil critique, so fuck it, we'll talk shit and use insults and slurs"". They want to talk shit, and they want to be taken seriously, but I don't think they can have it both ways. If you want to be the place where people can talk about NeoGAF sucking, I think you've got a big group in support of that idea (even from sides you might not expect). But if this place wants to talk shit like a bunch of 2edgy highschoolers, you're going to divide that support and drive people away who aren't interested in that bullshit.","Yes, I`m not saying it gets that shut down treatment elsewhere.

This is something that happens not just on GAF but on Twitter, YouTube, and outside of the internet. But yes, in practice, it's only the places where they CAN actually do that. I personally would like to be taken seriously when I`m actually being serious. This is not what you get on GAF. Can you count the amount of times you saw a serious post that happened to be on the wrong side mocked, driven-by, dismissed with one-liners, ad hominem and other fallacies?

It takes two to tango. If they can't handle it, they are free to continue avoiding this place and it won't be a loss for us. **And I am definitely not interested in placating those other people, because that is exactly how GAF (and others) got to where it is today, slowly but surely, by serving crybabies**",0,0,0,1.0,2.0

I honestly feel pretty gross that things got this bad, but I wanted to hear what TRP community thinks about my situation. Personally, I'm very upset over this and have ended things and ghosted her the last few days. She's not taking it well but it's expected.  Been dating this girl about 6 months, more serious in the last couple of months. Overall she treats me well and worships my dick. We fight sometimes, but it's usually over small things and we've been getting much better at resolving problems. The passion is great, the sex is great, we connect great on a personal level, I have fun with her and she has fun with me, so when things are good they're REALLY good. She's been constantly there for me, she buys things for me, she definitely invests in our relationship. But the truth is that you can have things be amazing 98% of the time, but that 2% is all it takes to completely break your relationship.  My GF is one of those ""has a lot of guy friends"" but they're not the kind of guy friends that try anything (at least not the ones I met). They're guys she grew up with, guys that are actual friends and know her family, guys that I met and I can tell they're good people and I trust them. We have boundaries anyways like she can't hang out alone with them drinking late into the night or any of that crap. She doesn't overstep her boundaries (that I know of). However, I have caught her in a couple of small white lies (red flag) which she usually admits to and apologizes for it. It does give me some trust issues obviously, but so far the lies have been small and harmless.  Fast forward to this event... for context, my girlfriend lives with a gay roommate (who wasn't around that night), and they're both in their mid 20s. They find that a lot of people in their building are seniors, so apparently they've been looking to make friends with people in their age range to have people to hang with. That night, she had a few close friends over and we decided to celebrate her bday by doing shrooms (my gf only did shrooms once in her life before) and drink. We were having a great time, she was high energy, she was drinking. In the middle of our trip, we step outside in her balcony for a smoke, and my gf and her friends notice some guys downstairs, so she ""jokingly"" calls out her apartment number to them. Guys show up to our unit with alcohol looking to obviously meet females, we're all a bit surprised and not really sure if we should let them in, my gf decides to let them in because they live in her building so it's safe. They quickly change their stance when they realize it's not that kind of party. They're nice guys, one even apologized to me saying he sees that I'm in a relationship with her. What was really strange to me was how excited my gf was to bring these guys into her life so quickly. Now to be fair, my gf is a friendly, outgoing, bubbly person, and that night she was high on shrooms and drinking, she was really high energy. But I've never in my 6 months of dating her seen her act so excited to be around new guys and give them her number so quickly with intent to hang out. It was the most uncomfortable disrespectful feeling I've experienced in the last 8 years of my life. Even fuck buddies would never do something like that in front of me. The next day I snapped at her and yelled at her, told her wtf was she thinking and why did she give them her number. She took the most naive clueless defence she could have taken, telling me it was perfectly harmless, they're just guys in her building, I was right there the whole time, they could tell we were together, they were nice guys, blah blah blah. She was incapable of understanding what she did and why it upset me. She tried to tell me that she was just looking at them as friends, potential guys her and her roommate can hang with or go party with if they ever throw parties. She even tried to say that one of the guys (the guys he gave her number to) was ""probably gay"" as if that would diffuse the situation at all. She kept saying that I need to just trust her, and that if these guys are a problem, I should have just calmly told her that I'm not comfortable with them hanging out and she would just not respond to their messages. But she doesn't get it. I should't have to explain to her what she did was wrong and that it bothered me. It should just be common sense. We talked the following day about it and she couldn't understand why this upset me so much and she should be allowed to make new friends. So I broke up with her and ghosted her.  I don't understand how she can be this ignorant and what the purpose of this whole thing was. My GF is super busy with work and school and so am I, so there should be no circumstances that she should be so excited to make guy friends with drunk strange men at 2am, and talking about partying with them. She was talking about exchanging numbers with 5 minutes of them stepping into the apartment. I'm of the opinion that if I'm dating a girl, she shouldn't be acting like an 18 year old college slut, excited to have some strange dick around. Those guys were tall, built, good looking dudes, so you know attraction had an influence. Those guys were doing nothing wrong, they were drunk, it was 2am, they were looking for a fun time, they heard some girl call out the apartment number for a party, they decided to come up and make friends. No beef with the guys, they were very nice and respectful to me, and my girlfriend was all over me the entire time and bragged about how good of a boyfriend I am to them. After an hour the guys left and then they came back a bit later because they were high and wanted to chill. We all sort of decided not to let them in so I went to answer the door and my gf asked me to be nice to them (WTF?). I calmly told them we're going to sleep soon and they left.  Overall, would you ghost her for this?",“My girlfriend was all over me the entire time and bragged about how good of a boyfriend I am to them.”    It sounds fine to me. I’m surprised you dumped her.,"Did you read the whole story? Lol she was also talking to them about partying in the future when they first arrived and she gave them her number eventually too. Not sure how you don’t see this after reading the full story.     If I picked up two drunk thots in front of my gf at 2am, invited them into my apartment, gave them my number, had them text me so I could save it in my phone, and then tell my gf that I’m so excited I made new friends, I think she’d leave me on the spot lol.

cs8z95i,trolling,"""A troll greater than yourself."" Okay, so, Alcoholics Anonymous. It's an interesting organization, with some colorful history. It's intentions are good and meant to help people with serious issues in their lives. For most, their alcoholism is merely masking other fucked up stuff.   Now while I feel that helping those such people is a morally good thing, the way they go about it has always bothered me. They push religion. Now, you can find some AA groups who pretty much eliminate as much of it as possible, as well as those who go full on Jesus mode, as well as everything in between....  But all of them have one thing in common, they claim to get sober you need ""A power greater than yourself.""   **Step One:**  Find an AA group near you which is moderately religious if you can, but not one that's extremest, or the will kick you out before the troll begins to ferment.   You show up, and you have to look bad. Disheveled. Smell bad. You have to look every bit the part. Get some coffee, and stay in the bad. Don't share, don't talk to anyone if you can avoid it, don't share your name, don't join in the group hug after end, don't talk to anyone. Just leave. But keep doing this about 3-4 times.   **Step Two:**   The next time you go, try to make  yourself slightly more presentable, but still bad off. I.e. like you've been off the sauce for a week, but not like you've turned your whole life around.   When your turn to talk comes up, just say your name and you pass. Be slightly more willing to talk to people but generally avoid conversations and don't share anything about you. Keep coming back about 5 times at this stage.   **Step Three:**   From here on in, you clean up more as time goes on. By now you should understand more about how the program works, and the kinds of things they say and expect to hear. Hears when you begin to play the part. Admit you're an alcoholic, and begin to reveal more and more over time of your well-rehersed story. Nothing to over the top.   Eventually it will come down to them telling you that you need a power greater than yourself. And they will say it can be anything. Even a doorknob.   **Step Four:**   This is when you strike. You choose ""Satan"" as your higher power. Don't back down on it. Own it, but don't act like a jerk about it. Just be like, ""I know Satan is more powerful than me, if I give my soul to him, he can cure my drinking""....   Continue going to meetings, slowly looking cleaner and better each time.   **Step Five:**   Don't stop before the miracle happened. As you continue to go, you get a Sponsor. You work the steps with them. And you continue to appear more and more clean, stable, sane, and let everyone know it. Let them all know how wonderful things are getting.   And you keep getting better every meeting. This is the kicker. Convince them that Satan is really working in your life to better you and to make things great, and most importantly keeping you off the sauce.   The longer you do this, the more utterly baffled they will be. It'll make them question their own faith, esp if they relapse and fail at ""working their own program"".   In time when you've convinced them that you life, was not only turned arround by Satan, but made glorious and wonderful and your a great happy good citizen who helps people, volunteers at an orphanage, etc, everything flawlessly perfect, you work your way out of coming as much.   Get them to think you're not going anymore because you're improved beyond needing it. And in that  you will accomplish ""The troll greater than yourself.""

e5amprv,GenderCritical,"My husband recently told me he thinks of himself as non-binary. Advice ? Note: I originally posted this story on r/relationships but the comments ended up locked pretty quickly and I didn't get much advice really.. I am new to this subreddit but I was referred here with this story, so, hopefully I'm in the right place ! My views have somewhat solidified since I wrote this originally so I've edited to reflect that.   For context, my husband B and I have been together for 4 years, lived together for the past 2, and have been married for 8 months. We have always had an absolutely wonderful relationship. We have been through so much together, and come through every challenge stronger in our relationship. We never fight, all problems we've had we dealt with through honest communication. It's never been perfect, but the love between us has always been apparent. I have never had any reason to doubt it.  A few months ago, B came to me and said he wanted to talk to me about something that has been on his mind. He told me that he sees himself as neither a man nor a woman, but instead lies somewhere in the middle of the spectrum between the two. He said that this is something that he's still exploring and doesn't have totally figured out yet. He said that he doesn't have any particular label in mind right now, just non-binary in general.  This came out of seemingly nowhere to me. My immediate emotional response was shock and discomfort, but I tried very hard to appear unmoved. It was a very vulnerable moment for him, and I didn't want him to recoil and not feel that he can talk to me about this. This conversation was about hearing him out, not about my feelings. He didn't say anything that would lead me to believe that this affects how he feels about us as a couple.  But now I feel deeply troubled and confused. B never presented as hyper-masculine, and that's something that I actually liked about him. I'm not at all into typical ""macho"" behavior/attitudes, so I viewed his more stereotypically feminine qualities as a huge plus and something that helped me relate to him on a deeper level than I've ever been able to with a man.. I'm just having trouble wrapping my mind around it. I didn't ask all the questions I maybe needed to, because I was putting so much effort into hiding my uneasiness. I don't know how much, if any, effort he is going to make into changing how he presents outwardly. I got the impression that he didn't either. So far, nothing is too different.  My main concern is just that I don't buy into this at all, but I don't know how to talk to him about it without coming off like I don't respect his views/personal identity. I feel like I'm holding in this big secret and it's really driving a wedge between us. I just don't know what to do ! Even just telling him the sentence ""I am attracted to men"" sent him into a spiral, and I thought that was just like... a given considering I married one and have never had sexual desires for other women ???

d80a8z6,TheRedPill,"[FR] Plate explains why Red Pill men are ""different"". **Summary:**  I've been seeing a girl for the past two weeks. I was out with her last night, at a cafeteria casually making out when, in between kisses, she lets out this: ""TAG, I like you because you are different from the rest"". Partly out of sheer curiosity and partly because I enjoy having my ego stroked every once in a while, I immediately pull away and tell her in a matter-of-factly manner: ""I'm not kissing you again until you give me three reasons why I'm awesome"". After some demands from her and me holding frame, she gives in and says the following:  **Body:**  1.""Of course, you are very handsome"". This struck me as absurd, because while my body is definitely well-built and lean she had never seen me shirtless, and I would objectively rate my face as a 6-7/10 on a good day. As a matter of fact I used to consider myself to be so ugly that no girl in their right mind would ever like me. My explanation for this remark is the following: when you maximize your genetic potential by proper grooming, styling and exercise, coupled with confidence, strong frame and good game, you can ""trick"" women into thinking that you are more attractive than you would ever consider yourself to be. Not trying to downplay the advantages of good facial aesthetics, but I'm saying that if you got dealt a mediocre hand like me you can more than make up for it with the way you present yourself. Sell yourself in the best way possible and her hamster will take care of the rest.  2.""I like your style, other men don't even know how to match colors"". She then proceeded to mention a lengthy list of her favorite outfits of mine. Honestly, this one came as no surprise. My sense of style is objectively great and my outfits are well thought-out. My fits used to consist solely of a pair of random nike trainers (usually neon green), a pair of blue bootcut jeans and oversized colorful tees and hoodies. Since then I have spent copious amounts of time on the malefashionadvice and streetwear subreddits trying to figure out what makes a good and a bad outfit, and it seems like the effort is paying off.  3.""I can trust you, I feel like I could tell you anything"". She actually had some trouble putting this into words. I believe she was trying to say that I inspire trust in her. I have already proven to her that I am do not hesitate to express my opinion, even if it might be going against what she thinks or wants. This confidence seems to be liberating for her, because she knows that any question will get her an honest answer, free of sugar-coated bullshit offered as a covert contract for sex. Remember, being overly dependent on a woman's approval is not only not sexy, it makes her feel suffocated by your neediness. There is another possible explanation: her father is a rich neurosurgeon, and from what I gathered quite authoritary. She has a good relationship with him. By exhibiting alpha traits I might have evoked a patriarchal figure in her mind, reminding her of her father and creating feelings of comfort and safety.  **Lessons Learned:**  * It's not so much about what you were given, but about the work you put in to maximize your potential.  * Your style needs to be on point; women notice that shit and appreciate attention to details.  * Expressing your honest opinion won't offend her. It will give her room to breathe and inspire respect.","I had a girl who complimented my dick and I simply laughed at her and sarcastically asked her to tell me more about how great my dick was.  Women are unconsciously Machiavellian.  They know men feel most loved when they are respected, so they manufacture compliments.  These compliments can be true or not, it really does not matter.  She felt that she loved you in the moment, and so by putting her on the spot to manufacture an explanation of why she loved you, she carefully crafted those things that would stroke your ego the most.  She knows you take pride in your clothes, so she complimented that.  Easy layup for her.  She said that you are handsome, but you disagreed in the genetic sense and flipped it to actually mean all those things that you worked so hard on and put so much effort into, so you did half the work on that.  Then she says she trusts you, so you hamstered that to mean you are just so confident and IDGAF, also things you worked on and feel good about.    She doesn't actually know why she likes you, she just responds to her feelz and rationalizes retroactive reasons of why she felt that way.  They could be true or false, but it doesn't matter.  The point being, if you don't care if a girl doesn't like you or can point out many flaws, then you equally shouldn't care about her compliments, because they are cheap and disingenuous.  Ego stroking from women is a pointless exercise because they use their evolved capacity for empathy, figure out how you work emotionally, and then reflect that back on you like they ""get you"".  It's a magic trick with no substance.

I'm crying and I feel pain somewhere, not sure if it's chest, stomach or something in my throat.  It gets really lonely sometimes. I need to talk to a man. I need to flirt. I want to be strong and stop craving the company of a man, but there are nights I can't hold myself. I'm using an anonymous app for chatting and I have two golden rules because of past experiences: under no circumstances should I believe a chat could turn into something more than just a chat and under no circumstances should I share pics of me.  Tonight I broke both rules. He told me he doesn't care about looks and I believed him. I sent him my pic, he said 'nice' and blocked me. I don't know him. I don't care about him. It's really not about him. It's about me, not giving up hope. It's about this part of me that still believes  there's someone out there for me, someone will see me as beautiful, someone who will hug me and sleep with me.

Never give someone that power over you.

Now I'm a good conversationalist, people enjoy talking to me but that's mainly because I use the tip in Carnegie's book, ""make everyone seem interesting"". I listen more than I talk, I'm good with women because I'm generally funny and can keep em talking for a long time and keep it fun, **because they do the talking**  But I have a problem, sometimes well, most of the time I feel I cant communicate my ideas well, people have often said that to me and I've noticed, I tend to repeat myself, midway through the sentence I realize what I say doesn't make sense, I feel like whenever I speak a lot, at some point I lose ""focus"" and I just ramble, some idea gets through, yes but not what I have to say.  It has evolved to the point where I have to write down a small script before having a phone conversation with someone and try to stick to it to the best of my skills, but if the conversation drags out for too long I feel like sometimes I answer out of instinct, the first thing that comes into my head instead of forming coherent ideas.  Same thing happens whenever someone asks me something out of the blue. The other day my boss asked me about the status of some repairs we had to do. I noticed my problem, paused, started thinking, spoke in clear articulated words and explained what happened, then he asked another question and I answered, then another and I started to ramble, in the end he mostly got what I meant but, I feel like I can't explain myself well.  I do tend to talk alone sometimes, but even then when I practice saying to myself (no one else) things that happened that same day, I start to ramble, change the subject, then change it again, then return, then change it then forget what I was saying and can't coherently connect that with what I started to say.  I'm generally an honest person, but not by choice I literally *can not* lie, because often when you lie you have to come up with the lie on the spot, and I'm just unable to do that, the only instances where I can lie is when I have time to prepare beforehand and practice infront of a mirror  I'm way better at writting because I have **time** to think what I try to say, but in my job sometimes there is no time to think you have to speak right then and there and I feel like its in those situations when my problem shows  It's frustrating, in the past few months I've avoided talking for long periods of time instead ask mostly questions.

For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished. Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.""

Looking at the Dow over just the past 18 months is in itself an incomplete picture of economic trends. It would appear that your position seeks to attribute the continued economic recovery to investors looking forward to a Trump presidency and his policies, rather than those policies enacted by the Obama administration? I'm sure any economist worth their salt would tell how ridiculous that is when Trump wasn't even being considered seriously as a potential Republican nominee until after the first Republican primary debate. Additionally, Trump hasn't been in office long enough to enact policies that we would be able to see the net results of yet. While it's true he hasn't mucked anything up economically, we cannot attribute any successes to him either.    As for the Russian collusion, the old saying goes ""where there's smoke, there's fire.""

We had a short convo can stopped texting, fuck it, moved on. Turns out she knows a girl-friend of mine, and the girl told me she was just getting out of a 2 year relationship not even a week ago and she was depressed. So I’m assuming that’s the reason I didn’t get very far.

She rejects him, then tells me I should add her on snap cause she needs some friends at the school (she was new). So I add her and she tells me she wants to hang out outside of school and what not. Flakes the first time and was about to cut her off for it because she initiated and didn’t come through on her word. But we get close, start talking to each other a little more but still very little contact and hanging out more (I didn’t know what an orbiter was back then because this was pre RP). But she mentioned she’s not looking for anything at the moment.

cztpo9c,TheRedPill,"How to meditate (book recommendation: ""The Mind Illuminated"" by Culadasa **TL;DR:** This is a recommendation for the book ""The Mind Illuminated"" by Culadasa ([Amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/The-Mind-Illuminated-Meditation-Integrating/product-reviews/0990847705/ref=cm_cr_pr_btm_link_2?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1&sortBy=recent&pageNumber=2)). In this post I'm giving you an overview of the book, and why you should buy it if you're interested in meditation.  ---  **Body:** I'm writing this since in a recent thread the topic of meditation came up, and it happens that I recently started reading this book, so I thought it'll be a good opportunity to recommend it to the community.  For a long time I wanted to meditate, and since about a year I've managed to have a more or less regular meditation practice. But one of the big problems is that there's hardly any good information out there on what exactly meditation is and how to do it. I've read a lot of the usually recommended books and articles, and while things got a little bit clearer I didn't really get the feeling that I understand much better what I do on the cushion. And I think this is a problem a lot of people encounter.  It's like wanting to get a nice physique and doing 40 pushups a day. It's better than nothing, but as we all know a proper full-body barbell training program is infinitely better than 40 pushups a day.  Enter this book. I recently got it and (full disclosure) I haven't read it through to the end yet, but I can already say that it's an absolute game changer. To start with, it has 476 pages, so there's a lot of info to take in. The author is an accomplished meditator, as well as a brain scientist, so he knows exactly what he's talking about, and the book reads like this. His clear, precise language leaves no questions unanswered. This is an actual text book. This is the manual for your brain you always wanted to read. And it's not a book you read once and be done with it. You'll be working with this book for the next couple of years.  Just look at this example:  > Keep your attention on the area where the breath sensations are clearest. Don't try to follow the air as it moves into the body or out of your nose. Just observe the *sensations* from the air passing over the spot where you're focusing your attention. Remember, the meditation object is the sensations of the breath, *not the breath itself.* (pg. 52)  Every single aspect of meditation is described in exactly this precise, practical manner. That was a small example of a small aspect of meditation, but I hope you can see from this how detailed his level of writing is.  Culadasa describes 10 stages of meditation and gives you exact and precise information on how to find out which stage you are at, what to do at each stage, how to do it and why to do it. For example, he doesn't only describe precisely how to focus your attention on the breath, he also tells you *why* to do it, and this is invaluable information, because you get an understanding of the bigger picture. The book is full of a-ha moments, where you suddenly understand exactly why meditation teachers say what they are saying.  There are a couple of interludes between the chapters about the stages, giving you information about how the mind is organized. For example, the first interlude talks about the difference between attention and awareness, and how they work together to form what is called mindfulness. This information gives you much needed context for your meditation practice. Later interludes introduce more insights into the structure of your mind and deepen information from earlier chapters. The book also never overloads you, as the information given in the interludes is relevant to the stages you are at.  He also talks about problems that will arise at each stage, why they arise and how to deal with them.  Also, he gives clear and precise definitions and explanations of terms. As I said earlier, after a long long time of researching mediation I found an actual definition of mindfulness.  The span of the book is the whole journey from the first time you sit down on the cushion to actual enlightenment itself. Now, if that isn't something that gets you excited, I don't know what will.  Yeah, I'm absolutely convinced this is the one book you need to have when you're interested in meditation. It's as close to your own, personal 24/7 meditation teacher as anything can probably get.  ---  **Lessons learned:** BUY THE BOOK!","Just ordered the paperback book on amazon.ca. Thanks for the recommendation /u/mahlzeit . This looks like a solid, no nonsense guide on meditation. I've found most of the literature on the subject is too rooted in Buddhist philosophy and often sound too vague and mystical and as a result I tend to give it up because the instructions are unclear. Hopefully this one will make me want to take up the habit again.     Another great book on meditation designed for a western audience is Tolle's ''The power of now''. I strongly recommend that one for anyone who's too caught up in the past, the future and those who can't let go of their pain: http://www.amazon.ca/The-Power-Now-Spiritual-Enlightenment/dp/1577314808","  Nice!

Can I ask what's the problem with this? I mean, why do you need to reject it?      I don't ever want to have children--but I dont reject childbirth. Lots of people don't want to ever be legally married, but they don't reject marriage, and seek out communities of ""anti-marriage"" individuals to complain with.      I really want to understand the underlying reason for rejecting something that **isn't** actively oppressing you.

I was raised on the idea that my life's purpose and plan in short, was go to college, get married, start a career, and have children. Think the 1950s white picket fence ideal. I have decided against that, if another guy wants to live his life that way then it's fine for him.     Instead I focus on finding fulfillment in my life through my hobbies and friendships. I don't hate women or blame them for anything. I still have relationships even but I have them because I enjoy spending time with the person. Im not trying to find the mother of my children or bag a trophy wife.     I sought out MGTOW since I thought it might be fun to talk with a group of guys who weren't focused on the traditional family unit or else trying to hook up with a bunch of women in order to get some sense of validation. I assumed it would be guys chatting about things like their hobbies and volunteer work. Maybe some stuff about casual ethically nonmongamous relationships. It's not like I did a ton of research.

e1pr7eg,Braincels,">  If you marry a virgin, she can’t compare you to anyone else.    I wouldn't trade my situation to be honest. I'm married to a girl I met in High School. We were both virgins when we met at 16, we remaining close / good friends for a long time. But We both had partners (both experienced a couple 2+ year relationships) and then we went from being ""best friends"" to ""girlfriend/boyfriend"" in our mid-20s. We've been together for a decade (ish) now, married. And it is fantastic to be married to my best friend. Seriously.    Regarding our past sexual partners, I'm glad I wasn't my wife's ""first"" - nothing to do with sex at all. But long-term relationships are seriously hard work. After 2-3 years or so, you really need to put some effort in to make sure you're relationship doesn't die. Now, I'm personally really glad that both myself AND my wife made all our LTR fuck-ups in previous relationships. We learn't some brutal lessons in previous relationships and I'm glad they're not baggage in THIS relationship (my marriage).    Also - sure, if you marry a ""virgin"" they can't compare you to someone else, if that is a concern. However, they will also wonder for their entire fucking life what it's like to have sex with someone who is NOT you. Their whole life. Think they'll manage??    Seriously, get all that shit (fucking) out of your system before ""settling down"". Marrying ""as"" and ""to"" a virgin is fine, but it's usually for irrational reasons (religious - which is terrible, marrying someone just so you can finally fuck them/someone is not exactly the fucking dream-marriage).     So - if I were going to get married again - I'd be incredibly skeptical about marrying a virgin. Assuming they end up liking sex - the best case scenario; I trust them completely and ""know"" they won't cheat. Well great, I'll just know my wife will never know (and ALWAYS WONDER. ALWAYS.) what sex with other people is like.    If you end up going on a ""break"" 10 years in, for a couple months. No prizes for guessing what they're ""up to"".",This is some serious coping.    Your glad your not your wife's first ? Literally no man has ever thought this,Some of you guys are seriously deluded.

Only problems you have are fucking 4 times a day and having a cock so hard you could fuck a hole in a car door.","Agree and disagree. Although I agree that everyone over the age of 35 should get on TRT, permablasting 500mg test will probably result in heart hypertrophy (left ventricular) and keeping lipids in check is a big if. Not a great idea.    And, unfortunately, testosterone doesn't have these crazy psychological effects you've described, even at high dosages. If you have low test and get on TRT, you will notice an incredible difference. However, the difference in mentality between normal test (~100-150 mg/week) and 500+ mg/week isn't *necessarily* that significant.     When I started my first cycle, I thought test was going to turn me into a sex fiend who would approach every hot girl in sight and end up fucking them in the bathroom. Yeah, it made me more confident and a bit more horny but the difference wasn't that crazy. I doubt that even going up to a gram would cause a huge change. I've been running test for over a year now at both of these dosages at different times, and I've heard plenty of similar anecdotes from people running these doses.

fe6b4xs,TheRedPill,"LF help with advising married friend (male 45ish) with his 1 year old son and wife (39ish) who is unhappy Long story short, I have a friend who is a really good bloke, but whose wife I don't know well. He recently told me she is struggling a bit and feeling unhappy. He is the sole breadwinner. She used to work, but went to part time after the baby was born and now doesn't work at all because part time was too much work while taking care of the baby. My friend and I agree that breastfeeding is important and that full time care-giving of the child by one parent is important. (This is as opposed to both parents working while paying for strangers to look after the baby and feeding it formula.)  I am concerned that his wife is being negatively influenced... because literally everything in our society is infected with feminism. Without knowing her (so, will correct myself if I am wrong), I am worried that sources are simply telling her to be unhappy without a job. Telling her to be unhappy with the child. Telling her to be unhappy with her husband because he is working his ass off to provide for them.  Now, I mean to get more detailed information from my friend and I have a general idea of what I want to advise him which is to not be passive. My friend is a good bloke but he's also a fairly normal guy. He doesn't want to be ""controlling"", but there is a real and serious danger of the divorce bullet and women being advised to do that and other insane life ruining things 24/7 from every source. Feminist TV/media, feminist friends, etc.  So what I think he needs to do is fill up her time with interesting and rewarding things. Her top priority needs to be taking care of the baby, but that's just not that much hard work if we speak frankly and the house is a small finite space that doesn't take much work. Also, considering that my friend is buying food for lunch every day I don't think she is doing very much housekeeping if she doesn't even make him lunch. But I digress.  She has recently been talking about taking the boy and staying with her parents for awhile. This set of alarm bells for me. I don't want to make my friend paranoid, but I don't think it is a good idea for her to be taking the boy away anywhere. His parents are nearby, though very elderly, so maybe she reasonably feels that its harder for her parents to be around, but I would suggest that even if it is more costly that it would be better for her parents to come to them rather than have the baby boy away from his father for weeks or (I fear) months.  I am going to do some research and compile some suggestions for my friend. I think he needs to get her into activities, preferably mostly with the baby and which are productive/educational/healthy like swimming lessons and activities with other mothers and similarly aged children, find ways for her to scratch the ""work itch"" in ways that are minimal like working for home and/or with very few hours, and generally cut her off from feminist home/family destroying influences (by filling her time with positive things because obviously can't actually prevent her from doing anything).  Basically, what I am hoping for from this post is any good/constructive ideas. My friend is already married and has a 1 year old boy so pointless to say not to marry.  Alright, cheers, any help appreciated.","Being unhappy and talking about taking the boy for awhile are huge red flags to me. She could have post partum depression or feel like she's losing her identity by being a stay at home mom. Going from independent career women to stay at home mom is a pretty significant change. Add that with all the garbage feminism shit about women not needing men and she'll feel conflicted.    I'm curious what their dynamic is now that there's a child in the picture. Does he recognize the red flag here? And did she have solid parents growing up?     For reference, I just got out of a 9 year relationship with 3 kids because my gf was unhappy. Never married.","I think he recognises it, which is why he told me, but doesn't have the tools to deal with it, which is why I am trying to figure out the plan for him.

crnhc8p,TheRedPill,"Can we discuss how tinder and similar applications may be creating a paradigm shift in dating? I know some female friends who use it just to boost their ego and some male friends who ""like"" every girl there in a desperate attempt of finding one interested.   The rule is, if both parties like the pictures of each other, the application will tell both that they may be compatible.   With these applications, girls can no longer evaluate self esteem and any other character traits of a guy (thus no red pill frame strategies), since they only see pictures of guys, judging them just for their looks. In one hand this interests only to girls who are still riding the cock carrossel, since they cannot find betas with cash there (they can find betas, but cannot directly evaluate their qualities) . On the other hand this creates a catalog of guys they can exploit for their own pleasure, like if men are a product in an online store.   What do you guys think about these new dating paradigms?",In one way apps like tinder have favored the Guys as a tinder date is almost guaranteed to end in sex.

She is very athletic and active and she travels the world. She has the right to exclude people with physical or mental disabilities from her dating pool, because those limitations would take away from her happiness (If her husband suddenly became disabled, it would be a totally different thing, as they have already been married for many years).     Dating preferences are discriminatory by nature. And they damn well should be. Equating romance to institutionalized racism, sexism, etc. is minimizing and invalidating.

e1iulcl,Trufemcels,"[LONG POST] I dated an Incel for 2 years Well,  thought I wanted to share some of my experiences with my first  boyfriend, who just happened to be an incel and a 'nice guy'. We were  together for 2 years.  To start things  off, I was a kissless virgin until I was 27 – I had other things like  taking care of a dying parent, hobbies, developing skills and going to  college that were much more important to me than finding a relationship.  Note: I'm 'demisexual' so I do not feel visual sexual attraction at all  so this wasn't a problem for me.  I don't drink alcohol, smoke or do  drugs. Those things make no sense to me, so I never partook in the wild  teen scene – I was also bullied growing up for wearing glasses and being  a 'hamplanet' with a BMI of 27.  Anyway, I  was feeling lonely because I had no friends in college so I started  messaging a guy here on reddit – he was interested about my personality  type and my country (scandinavian) so we talked back and forth. We did  not share pictures. He turned out to be a 22 year old, living with his  parents, not going to school. I originally thought he was much older  because of the way he wrote – but as many redditors, he was a pseudo  intellectual who liked to sound smart.  Long story short, he came to my country, moved into my apartment and we started dating. These were some of the experiences:  * I  went to school 	while he stayed home all day “working” on nothing. When  I came home and was tired, he demanded that I work on new skills  instead of resting. He saw my resting (watching tv, playing vidya) as me  being lazy. * He  paid no rent or food money because he saw that as a waste of his money  (the money his parents sent him). I supported the two of us on student  loans while he kept ordering gadgets and trash from the internet. * He  told me that my chosen field was worthless (art/design) and the only  ones that mattered were cooking and sciences (his interests). I almost  dropped out of school because of how shit it made me feel. * He  told me to stop cooking, and despite never having cooked in his life,  that he was naturally better than me – because his country had a richer  food culture than mine. * He  daily complained about my mother tongue and would show me videos of  other 	languages he thought sounded much better. (No joke. Daily) I felt  empathetic towards him because living here was so 'hard' for him... * He  said that I was a liar because before he came here I commented that he  was taller than me after he told me his height. He told me he was 5'7 –  but actually he was 5'5. I'm 5'6. He measured me quite a few times... * He'd  constantly tell me that he was seen as less of a man for being short  and even less attractive in womens eyes because he 'looked' like a  muslim and 	was extremely hairy. I'd remind him that I didn't care about  his height or his hairy back, that it didn't mean anything to me (My  father was 5'3 and my mother 5'7... I loved my father dearly and never  saw him as short. He was the strongest man in the world to 	me). But it  wasn't enough that I didn't care and accepted it. He wanted me to be  super sexually attracted to his height and hairyness. * He  was insanely private. I wasn't allowed to touch his computer or phone –  he'd flip out. Meanwhile I opened my apartment, all my things, my  phone, 	computer, everything to him. * He  told me I wasn't creative which crushed my self-esteem quite a bit. I'd  always  been that creative girl who drew and did art. Instead he saw  himself as a creative genius because he'd modify shit with tape and 	 string. * He  demanded that I get rid of my cat because he couldn't read him and  because he shedded his fur. I did so and it crushed me. Never again.  Turned out his hairs started being all over the floor instead... * When  we'd cuddle or lie together, he'd stare at my lips and remind me how  much he wished they were bigger because he was really into big lips and  blowjobs. (I hated them, his dick tasted awful, like mouldy clothes and  urine) * He  got mad at me for being better at English than him. That it was unfair  because he had put in more effort into learning it. (I had lived in the  UK for 2 years... sorry dude) * When  he'd ask me if I wanted to do something with him, 'No' was not an  answer. He didn't accept it and even admitted that when he 'asked' it  was only a formality. * He  put me on a pedestal, saying what a perfect angel I was. How I saved  him from his horrid life and how I was the perfect girlfriend and  perfect wife material. While dictating what things I liked and which I  didn't. He also wished that he had met me later in his life, because he  wanted to be with me forever, but he also wanted to experience other  women. * We  never had sex. He always wanted to wait for the 'perfect' time but used  me as a 	masturbation device every day instead. And if I didn't feel  like it, he'd get mad and petulant and threaten to leave me. He didn't  like 	me using a dildo because he thought that was basically like  cheating on him. So I wasn't allowed to masturbate. * He  didn't want me to talk to my best friend (the only friend I have  basically) and my 	family because it annoyed his ears when I talked in  my mother tongue on the phone. He also did not want me to visit them. * When  I broke up with him, he didn't take it seriously and thought we were  still 	together. He tried groping my breasts and I said no (thats  reserved for my BF in my mind), he'd say 'please don't take this away  from 	me'. He didn't respect my boundaries at all.  I  became a worse, bitter, resentful person with him. Lost all my  self-esteem and almost lost all contact with my best friend and my  family. I was miserable every day, fell into depression. Every time he  hugged me he was sucking the life out of me. I had nothing left to give  and he kept taking regardless.  After  moving away from him, getting on anti-depressants and talking things  through with a therapist, I'm finally back to my original self. I don't  regret the relationship at all because I learnt so many thing from it.  I'd much rather be alone than be with someone so toxic – I'm much better  on my own anyway, even if I have a lot to give. If I meet another man, I  will not judge him by the flaws of my ex. That is unfair. But I have  the courage and self awareness to end it much sooner if it turns sour.  **TL;DR:  Being alone is much better and more fulfilling than being in a  relationship for the sake of being in a relationship. Getting a  girlfriend/boyfriend will NOT solve your mental problems if you hate  yourself and is miserable. Do not put that shit on another person.**","Oh my god, that guy was a total douche!

I found out that the answer to that is 6. 6 x 16 is 96 and 96 divided by 12 is 8. Thus, he is 8 feet tall. His large stature is shows clearly in the following examples.

djs70sm,sjwhate,"The question then becomes ""why are feminine professions paid less than masculine ones?"" Which I think is where there may be some criticism. Why is math more valuable than teaching children?","One argument COULD be the simple supply/demand concept that there are more people willing to be teachers than mathematicians and thus increases the wages for mathematicians since there is a greater demand than there is a supply for them. Possibly. I'm not looking at any stats to support this, but it's the first thing that comes to mind. Nor am I taking any stance on how wages should be reflected per job.","It could be. I wasn't really taking a stance either. I was just pointing out that I think many sjw's don't make the right argument when talking about the wage gap. I think discussing why ""feminine"" professions are paid less than ""masculine"" professions is probably a better use of their time since it is super rare for a woman in the same position as a man to actually earn less than the man.     Additionally, the conversation then naturally goes to the next question ""how do we get women more interested in higher paying 'masculine' careers in order to close the 'wage gap.?'"" Which is a question that I think most reasonable people agree should be something people work towards.     Basically, we could have more productive conversation and less bitching if people just talked about the right things and agreed on the things normal people can agree on.",0,0,0,6.0,2.0
